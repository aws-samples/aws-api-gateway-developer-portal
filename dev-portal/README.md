## Development guide

### Getting Started
1. Create a private S3 bucket for putting zipped lambda functions and zipped templates in. Note the bucket name for the next step.

2. Create a `deployer.config.js` file inside `/dev-portal/` with the following structure:

```js
// replace your-lambda-artifacts-bucket-name with the name of the bucket you created in step 1
// then, replace 'custom-prefix-' in siteAssetsBucket and apiAssetsBucket with your name / your org name / some unique identifier
// the resulting bucket names need to be globally unique

module.exports = {
  stackName: `dev-portal`,
  buildAssetsBucket: `your-lambda-artifacts-bucket-name`,
  siteAssetsBucket: `custom-prefix-dev-portal-static-assets`,
  apiAssetsBucket: `custom-prefix-dev-portal-artifacts`
}
```

3. Run `npm run release`. This will build the static assets, deploy them, and generate the `dev-portal/public/config.js` file needed for local development. Take note of the bucket names you use

4. Run `npm run start` to start the local development server at `localhost:3000`.

5. Make changes locally, test them at `localhost:3000`, and, when satisfied, run `npm run release` to build and upload the changes to your  cloud dev portal.

### npm Scripts

### `build` -- `npm run build`

Builds a production-quality build and copies it to the lambda uploader.

### `deploy` -- `npm run deploy`

Starts a `sam package` and `sam deploy`. Does not build, but does write the config after a successful deploy.

### `write-config` -- `npm run write-config`

Gets the output from the CFN stack and writes a local version of the config.js file, so that you can run locally.

### `release` -- `npm run release`

Synonymous with `npm run build; npm run deploy; npm run write-config`.

### `start` -- `npm run start`

Starts up the local development server. Must have a `config.js` file locally for this to work.

### Notes on static assets

The static assets are only re-uploaded on deployment if the previous deployment and the current deployment were provided different `StaticAssetRebuildToken` parameters. The `npm run deploy` script automatically creates a unique `StaticAssetRebuildToken` for you.

### Batch-adding license information
Run these commands, then git add -p and filter out unnecessary changes. This will sometimes change the file's final line ending, mangle internal regex, etc., so do be attentive to the diffs.
